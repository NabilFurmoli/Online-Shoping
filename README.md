Hi dear,

The site is published at https://nabilfurmoli.github.io/Online-Shoping/

The application is very straight forward to be tested. Simply download the zip file
and open the html file via your web browser (Chrome prefered).

Note: Although I could have used javascript framworks such as React or Angular, 
but I have decided to implement it with vanila javascript and jQuery. 

Languages and Tools Used: Javascript (ES6), jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards.
