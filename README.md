Note: Although I could have used javascript framworks such as React or Angular, 
but I have decided to implement it with vanila javascript and jQuery. 

Testing Note: I have included the Williams-Sonoma-test.js i the root directory.
              In order to run the test file Please follow these steps.
                  1: Create a directory and name it for instance webDriverTestDir
                  2: Download and add the Williams-Sonoma-test.js in the directory.
                  3: Install node.js if missing in your operating system.
                  4: Install ChromeDriver (In windows ChromeDriver can be easily installed using Chocolatey package manager)
                  5: Run the Williams-Sonoma-test.js file using command: node Williams-Sonoma-test.js
                
Languages and Tools Used: Javascript (ES6), jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Selenium Webdriver.
